module Watson
  # [todo] - Replace all regex parentheses() with brackets[] if not matching
  #        Was using () to group things together for syntax instead of []
  #        Replace so we can get cleaner matches and don't need to keep track of matches

  # [todo] - Change debug_print to provide its own \n

  # [todo] - Add ability to pass "IDENTIFY" to debug_print to auto print method entry info

  # [todo] - Make sure all methods have proper return at end

  # [review] - Method input arg always renamed from arg to _arg inside method, change this?
  #        Not sure if I should just make input arg _arg or if explicit _ is useful

  # [todo] - Add option to save output to specified file
  # [todo] - Replace Identify line in each method with method_added call
  #      http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Module.html#method-i-method_added

  # Separate ON and OFF so we can force state and still let
  # individual classes have some control over their prints

  # Global flag to turn ON debugging across all files
  GLOBAL_DEBUG_ON = false
  # Gllobal flag to turn OFF debugging across all files
  GLOBAL_DEBUG_OFF = false

  # [review] - Not sure if module_function is proper way to scope
  # I want to be able to call debug_print without having to use the scope
  # operator (Watson::Printer.debug_print) so it is defined here as a
  # module_function instead of having it in the Printer class
  # Gets included into every class individually
