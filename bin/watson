# [review] - Using own funky path loading because traditional way seems wrong?
# Commented out version is traditional, seen in many apps. If you use that and
# look at load_path you get path/../lib (I'd expect those to be separate?)
# My funky version adds path/., path/bin, path/assets separately
# Maybe I don't get how the load path is supposed to look though...

#$:.unshift File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), *%w[.. lib])
$:.unshift *%w[. assets lib].map { |m| __dir__.gsub(/\/bin(.?)+/, '') + '/' + m }
